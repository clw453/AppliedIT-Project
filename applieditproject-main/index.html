                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">"The Colorado River Guides team is the best. They accommodated our small family group and gave us a great guide. We had a wonderful time
                        on the river, with part of the group in the raft with (the guide) and my dad and I piloting a ducky with my 6 and 9 year old kids rotating in and out of the ducky
                        during the trip. Lots of fun with a great guide in a nice easy section of the Colorado perfect for a family with young kids.
                        We're definitely coming back and will plan on the more challenging white water trips when the kids get older. Thanks!"

                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">"We were staying in Steamboat and wanted to avoid going back via Kremmling. Looked up rafting companies in the area and phoned a few.
                        Brenda returned my call and was happy to have Paul take us on a trip the next morning. Driving down hwy 131 was scenic! It was a beautiful Colorado day on the beautiful
                        Colorado River. Our wildlife sightings: 3 different bald Eagles, a muskrat, and a mink near the water. It was a safe trip to take our 2 Kids(both 7).
                        Our kids really enjoyed having Lucy (Paul & Brenda's dog) along for the ride and enjoyed playing fetch with her. Thank you for a wonderful trip!"

                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">"This is our second year to raft with Colorado River Guides, and just as much fun as the first. As a family of four, we chose to take two ducky
                        boats (inflatable two person kayaks) with an adult and kid (9 and 12 year old boys) in each one. We loved being close to the water, getting wet on the rapids,
                        but still having the guides right there to make sure we were taking the best path through the water. Great guides, emailed directions made it easy to get there, a
                        nd the super mascot, Xena the amazing Golden Retriever! We would strongly recommend them for a family raft!"

                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">"I've white water rafted several rivers and had actually done the Eagle a few years ago. But the water today was Absolutely Awesome! Our guide was Paul.
                        He is one of the best guides I've ever been with. He made all of us feel comfortable! I didn't think
                        I would ever be able to make another white water trip but Paul made my dreams come true today. We took our 14 year old grandson on his first adventure and he loved it.
                        Paul put my husband, grandson, and myself right at ease.
                        He taught us the history, and geology, of the river all along the way. The rapids are perfect right now. Plenty of excitement for young or old. Thanks Paul for making my dream come true.
                        Would recommend this for anyone wanting to try whitewater rafting." <br> -Beverly T. </p>
