            <p class="text-white mb-4"> Colorado River Guides has had the luxury of calling Steamboat Springs and the Yampa Valley home for almost 30 years. We have raised our family on the
            rivers surrounding Steamboat Springs, and would love the opportunity to share these beautiful rivers, steep canyons, and rushing rapids with your family too. Our certified,
            experienced river guides will work hard to ensure you and your family have an amazing trip. <br><br> Our Colorado River rafting trips, departing daily, meet on the river about an hour South of Steamboat.
            They are the perfect raft trip for the entire family. Kids and adults alike love our splashy interactive duckies, while those looking for a more relaxed and scenic float will enjoy our 
            guided rafts.  The Eagle River (flow dependent) is fantastic for those looking for more excitement and adrenaline. The Eagle River’s snow-fed waters rush down from some of the most famous ski resorts in the 
            world right through the heart of the Rocky Mountains. Our Eagle River trips offer daily departures (May-June) meeting on the river about 1 hour and 45 minutes 
            South of Steamboat Springs.<br>

              Brenda returned my call and was happy to have Paul take us on a trip the next morning. Driving down hwy 131 was scenic! It was a beautiful Colorado day on the beautiful
              Colorado River. Our wildlife sightings: 3 different bald Eagles, a muskrat, and a mink near the water. It was a safe trip to take our 2 Kids(both 7). 
              Our kids really enjoyed having Lucy (Paul & Brenda's dog) along for the ride and enjoyed playing fetch with her. Thank you for a wonderful trip!"

              <p class="text-muted mb-0">"This is our second year to raft with Colorado River Guides, and just as much fun as the first. As a family of four, we chose to take two ducky
              boats (inflatable two person kayaks) with an adult and kid (9 and 12 year old boys) in each one. We loved being close to the water, getting wet on the rapids,
              but still having the guides right there to make sure we were taking the best path through the water. Great guides, emailed directions made it easy to get there, a
              nd the super mascot, Xena the amazing Golden Retriever! We would strongly recommend them for a family raft!"

              <p class="text-muted mb-0">"I've white water rafted several rivers and had actually done the Eagle a few years ago. But the water today was Absolutely Awesome! Our guide was Paul. 
              He is one of the best guides I've ever been with. He made all of us feel comfortable! I didn't think
              I would ever be able to make another white water trip but Paul made my dreams come true today. We took our 14 year old grandson on his first adventure and he loved it.
              Paul put my husband, grandson, and myself right at ease.
He taught us the history, and geology, of the river all along the way. The rapids are perfect right now. Plenty of excitement for young or old. Thanks Paul for making my dream come true.
Would recommend this for anyone wanting to try whitewater rafting." <br> -Beverly T. </p>
